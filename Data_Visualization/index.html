    <h1>Pedaling Through Policy: A Data-Driven Look at Toronto’s Bike Lane Debate</h1>
    <p>In recent years, urban infrastructure planning has become a focal point of debates surrounding sustainable city
        living. One prominent discussion in Toronto is the provincial government’s proposal to remove bike lanes along
        Yonge, Bloor, and University Streets. These streets are central to the city's downtown core and serve as vital
        thoroughfares for commuters, cyclists, and pedestrians alike. The removal of bike lanes raises questions about
        its potential impact on the neighborhoods these streets traverse, including changes to commute patterns,
        accessibility, and the quality of life for residents.
        This article explores the characteristics of the neighborhoods directly affected by the proposed
        changes using data from the 2021 Census, sourced from the City of Toronto’s open data portal. By analyzing
        demographics, commute patterns, and socio-economic factors, this analysis aims to provide a data-driven
        perspective on the implications of this decision.</p>

        Task Overview
        The primary objective of this project is to create a visualization-rich, interactive article to assess the
        impact of bike lane removal on affected neighborhoods. The article uses data visualization techniques to:
        Explore Demographics: Highlight age, income, education, and work industry distributions across neighborhoods
        along Yonge, Bloor, and University Streets.
        Analyze Commute Patterns: Examine how residents of these neighborhoods travel, including the proportion of
        cycling commuters and the average commute times.
        Profile Neighborhoods: Compare these neighborhoods to city-wide trends, emphasizing their unique attributes and
        potential vulnerabilities to bike lane removal.
        The visualizations serve to make complex data accessible to a broader audience, including city planners,
        policymakers, and residents interested in understanding the local impact of this controversial policy proposal.

        All visualizations were created using Python and interactive visualization libraries such as Altair. Data was
        preprocessed to ensure accuracy and clarity, with missing values handled through appropriate imputation methods.
        The article incorporates user feedback gathered through formative evaluations, ensuring the content resonates
        with its target audience.
