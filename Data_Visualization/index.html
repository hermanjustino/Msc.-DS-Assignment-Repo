    <p>In recent years, urban infrastructure planning has become a focal point of debates surrounding sustainable city
        living. One prominent discussion in Toronto is the provincial government’s proposal to remove bike lanes along
        Yonge, Bloor, and University Streets. These streets are central to the city's downtown core and serve as vital
        thoroughfares for commuters, cyclists, and pedestrians alike. The removal of bike lanes raises questions about
        its potential impact on the neighborhoods these streets traverse, including changes to commute patterns,
        accessibility, and the quality of life for residents.
        This article explores the characteristics of the neighborhoods directly affected by the proposed
        changes using data from the 2021 Census, sourced from the City of Toronto’s open data portal. By analyzing
        demographics, commute patterns, and socio-economic factors, this analysis aims to provide a data-driven
        perspective on the implications of this decision.

    <h1>Task Overview</h1>
    <p>The primary objective of this project is to create a visualization-rich, interactive article to assess the
        impact of bike lane removal on affected neighborhoods. The article uses data visualization techniques to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Explore Demographics:
            <ul>
                <li>Highlight age</li>
                <li>Income</li>
                <li>Education</li>
                <li>Work industry distributions across neighborhoods along Yonge, Bloor, and University Streets</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Search Neighborhoods</h2>
    <input type="text" id="searchInput" placeholder="Search for neighborhoods...">
    <table id="neighborhoodTable">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th onclick="sortTable('name')">Name</th>
                <th onclick="sortTable('population')">Population</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody id="neighborhoodList">
            <!-- Neighborhoods will be populated here by JavaScript -->
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <p>
        All visualizations were created using Python and interactive visualization library Chart.js. Data was
        preprocessed to ensure accuracy and clarity, with missing values handled through appropriate imputation methods.
        The article incorporates user feedback gathered through formative evaluations, ensuring the content resonates
        with its target audience.

    <h2 class="heading">Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        This site represents the beginning of a broader exploration into how Toronto’s bike lane infrastructure impacts
        its residents. The current visualizations provide valuable insights into neighborhood characteristics, cycling
        habits, and commuting trends, but this is just the first step.
        Future updates will incorporate sentiment analysis from social media platforms and Google search trends to
        capture a dynamic picture of public opinion.
        <br>By layering these insights with the existing data, the site will
        evolve into a comprehensive resource for understanding the interplay between infrastructure, policy, and
        community needs.
        Thank you for visiting and exploring this first draft. Feedback and suggestions are welcome as I work to refine
        and expand this project to better serve Toronto’s residents and urban planners.
