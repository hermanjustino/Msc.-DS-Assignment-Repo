Overview
Predict Supercars Prices 2025
Welcome to the Predict Supercars Prices 2025 competition!

Your goal is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts the market price of supercars based on detailed specifications, condition, and service history.

Using a rich dataset of supercars from 2020 to 2025, including features like engine type, horsepower, damage history, warranty status, and more, you will train your model to estimate the price in USD.

This competition challenges your ability to extract meaningful insights from complex automotive data and deliver precise price predictions.

Good luck, and have fun!

Description
Predict Supercars Prices 2025
About the Domain
The supercar market is highly dynamic and complex, influenced by numerous factors such as brand prestige, technical specifications, condition, and historical maintenance. Predicting the price of supercars is a challenging regression problem due to the diversity of features and the impact of vehicle history.

Supercars are high-performance vehicles known for their powerful engines, advanced aerodynamics, and luxurious materials. Their prices fluctuate based on factors including damage history, mileage, engine type, and rarity (e.g., limited editions).

Problem Statement
In this competition, your task is to build a predictive model that estimates the market price of supercars from 2020 to 2025. You will be provided with a detailed dataset containing over 30 features describing each vehicle, including:

Brand and model name
Year of manufacture
Engine configuration (V8, V10, V12, Electric, etc.)
Horsepower and torque
Damage history and repair costs
Warranty status and years remaining
Service history (authorized or independent)
Mileage and number of previous owners
Exterior and interior details (color, materials, carbon fiber body parts)
Tire and brake specifications
Limited edition status and aero package presence
Your model should accurately predict the selling price in USD, considering all the above factors.

Dataset
The dataset includes:

Training data: Features and the target price for 2,000 supercars.
Test data: Similar features without price information, for which you will generate predictions.
Sample submission: Format example for submitting your predictions.
Evaluation Metric
Your submissions will be evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) between the predicted and actual prices. Lower RMSE indicates better performance.

Why Participate?
This competition offers a realistic, complex regression challenge in the automotive domain, ideal for practicing feature engineering, handling missing data, and model tuning with high-dimensional data.

Good luck, and enjoy predicting supercar prices!

Evaluation
Submissions are evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) between the predicted prices and the actual sale prices:


Where:

( y_i ) is the true price of the ( i^{th} ) car
( \hat{y}_i ) is your predicted price
( n ) is the number of samples in the test set
A lower RMSE means your predictions are closer to the real prices.

üì§ Submission File Format
Your submission should be a CSV file with 2 columns:

ID	price
car_uniqueid1	350000.00
car_uniqueid2	1250000.00
car_uniqueid3	475000.00
‚Ä¶	‚Ä¶
ID corresponds to the unique identifier of each supercar in the test set.
price is your predicted sale price for that car (in USD, float format).
‚úÖ Important Notes:

The file must include a header row.
The order of rows does MATTER, as long as all test IDs are included.

Dataset Description
In this competition, you'll predict the sale price of high-end supercars based on a rich set of technical, aesthetic, and historical attributes. The dataset contains both numeric and categorical features commonly associated with premium performance vehicles ‚Äî from horsepower and drivetrain to service history and damage reports.

üìÅ Files
supercar_train.csv ‚Äî the training set, including features and the target variable price.
supercar_test.csv ‚Äî the test set, with the same structure as train.csv, but without the price column.
sample_submission.csv ‚Äî a sample of how your submission should be formatted.
üß† Target Variable
price: The final sale price of the supercar (in USD). This is what you are trying to predict.
üìä Columns
